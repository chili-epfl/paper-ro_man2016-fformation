\begin{abstract}
In this paper we present a study in which we test the influence of child-robot spatial arrangement on child's focus of attention, child's perception of robot's performance in the CoWriter learning by teaching activity.
In this activity the child teaches a Nao obot how to handwrite. 
In our study, we explore two spatial condition from Kendon's F formation, the side-by-side and the face-t-face formations. 

We have 3 conditions following Kendon's F formation: 
\begin{itemize}
\item side by side
\item face to face
\item in L shape
\end{itemize}

\section{INTRODUCTION}
Cowriter

In this activity the child plays the role of a teacher. 



\section{RELATED WORKS}

Role attribution

Kendon F Formation in HRI
\cite{huttenrauch2006investigating}

We propose to study the impact of spatial arrangement on engagement of children a handwriting task
\section{APPROACH}

within subject, 2 robots in front of the child who has to teach to the two robots


Hypothesis
\begin{itemize}
\item Child feels more in a teacher student relationship when facing the robot
\item child feels more in a peer to peer when the robot is in L or side by side 
\item how does it influence the engagement -> with-me-ness
\item  does the child looks more at the experimenter when the robot is badly behaving
\item how does the child rates the robots performances according to  the arrangement
\end{itemize}


\section{METHOD}

\section{RESULTS}

\subsection{Seriousness}

\subsection{With-me-ness}
Present it as a measure of synchrony, 

Get time when robot looking where and see if similar pattern with child

\subsection{Performances}

\subsection{Questionnaire on likeability and Interrelationship}

\section{CONCLUSIONS}



\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.

	abstract = {We examined the effects of a cotaught handwriting and writing program on first-grade students grouped by low, average, and high baseline legibility. The program's aim was to increase legibility, handwriting speed, writing fluency, and written expression in students with diverse learning needs. Thirty-six first-grade students in two classrooms participated in a 12-wk handwriting and writing program cotaught by teachers and an occupational therapist. Students were assessed at pretest, posttest, and 6-mo follow-up using the Evaluation Tool of Children's Handwriting-Manuscript (ETCH-M) and the Woodcock-Johnson Writing Fluency and Writing Samples tests. Students made large gains in ETCH-M legibility ($\eta$² = .74), speed ($\eta$²s = .52-.65), Writing Fluency ($\eta$² = .58), and Writing Samples ($\eta$² = .59). Students with initially low legibility improved most in legibility; progress on the other tests was similar across low-, average-, and high-performing groups. This program appeared to benefit first-grade students with diverse learning needs and to increase handwriting legibility and speed and writing fluency.},

In this paper, we present NovA (NOnVerbal behavior Analyzer), a system that analyzes and facilitates the interpretation of social signals conveyed by gestures, facial expressions and others automatically as a basis for computer-enhanced social coaching. NovA records data of human interactions, automatically detects relevant behavioral cues as a measurement for the quality of an interaction and creates descriptive statistics for the recorded data. This enables us to give a user online generated feedback on strengths and weaknesses concerning his social behavior, as well as elaborate tools for offline analysis and annotation.},

In total 33 participants took part in three different scenarios; verbal interaction, physical interaction and no interaction. Participant control over the robot, and approach direction was also varied. Measurements of the preferred robot approach distance was obtained, and analysed along with the participants' demographic and personality data. The results indicate differences in approach direction preferences based on gender. Also, results show that the participants' personality traits of extraversion and conscientiousness are associated with changes in approach distance preferences according to robot autonomy. The results are discussed in light of relevant literature from the social sciences.},

@article{Kanda2004,
	abstract = {Robots increasingly have the potential to interact with people in daily life. It is believed that, based on this ability, they will play an essential role in human society in the not-so-distant future. This article examined the proposition that robots could form relationships with children and that children might learn from robots as they learn from other children. In this article, this idea is studied in an 18-day field trial held at a Japanese elementary school. Two English-speaking “Robovie” robots interacted with first- and sixth-grade pupils at the perimeter of their respective classrooms.Using wireless identification tags and sensors, these robots identified and interacted with children who came near them. The robots gestured and spoke English with the children, using a vocabulary of about 300 sentences for speaking and 50 words for recognition. The children were given a brief picture–word matching English test at the start of the trial, after 1 week and after 2 weeks. Interactions were counted using the tags, and video and audio were recorded. In the majority of cases, a child's friends were present during the interactions. Interaction with the robot was frequent in the 1st week, and then it fell off sharply by the 2nd week.Nonetheless, some children continued to interact with the robot. Interaction time during the 2nd week predicted improvements in English skill at the posttest, controlling for pretest scores. Further analyses indicate that the robots may have been more successful in establishing common ground and influence when the children already had some initial proficiency or interest in English. These results suggest that interactive robots should be designed to have something in common with their users, providing a social as well as technical challenge},

Robotic sys- tems that aim to learn effectively from human teachers must similarly be able to engage in perspective taking.We present an integrated architecture wherein the robot’s cognitive function- ality is organized around the ability to understand the environ- ment from the perspective of a social partner as well as its own. The performance of this architecture on a set of learning tasks is evaluated against human data derived from a novel study exam- ining the importance of perspective taking in human learning. Perspective taking, both in humans and in our architecture, fo- cuses the agent’s attention on the subset of the problem space that is important to the teacher. This constrained attention al- lows the agent to overcome ambiguity and incompleteness that can often be present in human demonstrations and thus learn what the teacher intends to teach.},
